# Code-Palette

## About the Project
I created Code-Palette to showcase my experience and knowledge with various programming languages. While the majority of the code presented here does not function as fully developed applications, it is a compilation of projects, assignments, and personal practice I have completed during my time studying Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This repository features programming languages such as **Java**, **Python**, and **C**, but will continue to be expanded with more of my work.

## Installation
Since this is a display of my coding skills, it would make sense to try and download the files and test them out. I recommend using an online IDE for my C or Python programs. However, some of my Java programs require multiple files to run, so downloading their respective folders and running them in software like VsCode will be necessary.

## Usage
The only purpose of these programs is to observe and test them. They don't provide any practical use, but they may serve as inspiration for other projects.

## Credits
While not all of the code presented here is entirely my own creation, it is important to acknowledge that many of these programs are based on assignments from my time at UNC - Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics. Credit must be given where credit is due..
