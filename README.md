# Miscellanous-Languages

## About the Project
Miscellanous-Languages was created so I could demonstrate some of the programming languages and their features I have had expose to and experience working with. A majority of the code that is showcased are not fully functional applications in a professional sense. REally, this is a collection of projets, assignments, and personal practice I have accumulated as a Computer Science Student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This features, programming languages such as ** Java **, ** Python **, and ** C **. This respository is due to be expanded on with more of the code I have worked on.

## Installation
Seeing as this is a showcase of code I have worked on, it wouldn't seem farfetch to try and download the files here to test it out. In order to test my C or Python programs I would sugguest using an online IDE. However, for my Java programs some require multiple files to run, so downloading their respective folders onto your machine and running them in an IDE such as VsCodewill be needed.

## Usage
Other than observing and testing out these programs. There isn't any utility to be offered. At best these programs can be used for inspiration.

## Credits
Not all of the code here is my complete and orginal work. As mentioned before a lot of these programs are derivatives from school assignments so credit ought to be given to the College of Computing of Informatice at UNC - Charlotte.
